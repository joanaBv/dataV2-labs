The LA PD used two main programs in an atempt to predict and prevent crime, Operation LASER and PredPol. Operation LASER focused on gathering intel over a two year time span on individuals, reviewing their previous criminal record, atributing points to their crimes with the objective of creating lists with the most likely reoffenders. PredPol aimed at predicting property crimes by taking a daily look at what crimes were preformed and where, later emiting updated maps with possible crime hotspots.
Both these measures came about in an attempt to more efficiently manage police resources by focusing patrols on certain areas and keeping certain individuals under a watchful eye. However, these programs endend up prepetuating a vicious cycle of racism already very present in the system in which they were integrated. The data utilized to generate these predictions was very biased and unjust which necessarily brought on a biased and unjust prediction system, prepetuating the racist over policing of empoverished and minority comunities.
These programs were oposed by several organizations, leading to their temporary disbandment, later being reintroduced under a renamed and rebranded disguise.
